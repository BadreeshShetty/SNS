headermsg("""As you see the probabilities are low, but maybe God and fate brought us there. üòÖ Call me eccentric, weird, or determined - that's for you to decide. 
I understand if you despise me; I've never been despised by anyone before other than my mother JK. üòÖüòÇ I usually mind my own business and don't bother anyone.
I'm not sure if I deserve to know you or am the right guy. I know I'm not that bad, even though 'bad' is in my name. üò¢
But once you get to know the funny, quirky, adventurous, and emotional side of me, I bet you'll never regret knowing me better or earlier.
You made me look inward and opened me up to my thoughts and expression. I don't usually open up like this, but on my way back to Boston from Miami, 
I spoke to a lady in her early 60s who was visiting her ailing mother. Her mom's story, at 80 years old, dating a 65-year-old man, shook me (long story). 
In my usual scenario, I would never open up, but I showed her your picture from Boston (sorry for invading your privacy). She told me you look like a doctor.
I jokingly said that you can't cure my disease though. JK :) I was really in a bad state mentally but the folks (Puerto Rican Aunt and a Colombian Family) 
on the flight (see pics below) cheered me. You also made me think outside the box and got my creative juices flowing, which I didn't know I had yet. 
I know you don't feel anything for me or have any interest in me. Sometimes intuitive feelings can be wrong. 
I don't have the luxury to know you in real-time. Time and feelings can change if you just give it a thought. It's perfectly fine with me.
I'm sorry for intimidating you with those 40+ calls in Miami. I know you're a strong woman, but I was also scared when you didn't pick up for your safety. 
I usually don't speak about myself ever because I don't care about it or because I know I'm the least self-obsessed person. 
Many consider me a nice guy and an gentleman; I don't know if you think the same of me. But there's a famous saying that nice guys finish last, and to some extent, it's true. 
However, I don't want to give up on this race. üò¢ My friends know me as jovial, authentic, funny, knowledgeable, helpful, caring, adjusting, accommodating, overthinker, etc.
I've always tried to see the best in a person. You're smart, independent, straightforward, witty, funny, strong, bold, a risk-taker, diplomatic, calm, and understanding. 
It's very difficult to find someone like you. I know times are tough with jobs, responsibilities, and life in general. There are a lot of 'ifs.' 
But I guarantee one thing: this won't be an error. I don't know what impresses you. 
I am not the one to force anyone I just wanna be heard once and also for you get to know me as a person. I wanted to know your though process.
I just don't wanna lose someone good without you knowing where I come from and what it means to me. 
Your 1 in 7,900,000,000 (approximate world Population) chance might surpass the low probability mentioned above by a big margin. 
Even thought the probability of this chance seems even lower than the above estimated probability (In image) PS: Its from almighty ChatGPT. 
But it's an another effort nonetheless.
I apologize for everything and ask forgiveness If I said or done anything wrong before and now. 
I have been frank, authentic, genuine to what I feel and have done for you to the highest order possible from my side. 
I understand emotions quite well textually and in real. Your late reply to my messages. I could see you not wanting to see my face in Miami. 
The first Hi only made it evident for me. But still I had been fooling myself all along till now. If we had ever met again there and you would have known what I am. 
What I am not. I always wanted to make you feel special. I always felt I was misunderstood all along. Those misunderstandings would‚Äôve been cleared. 
Those 2 months of getting to know you was really good phase for me. Sometimes doing the small things matter. I did everything I could for you from my side. 
I have to live with the fact that presumptions outweigh genuine efforts. I just wish you just knew me better because you would‚Äôve never done this to me. 
I am not the one who usually calls anyone much. We both are the same boat being Data something in our careers and have a lot of commonalities but still a lot of differences. 
I felt like an Non Playable Character in Gods Game there (Miami). I put myself through a lot for this and everything till now. You made me show my reality and double question myself every moment from now on as I already used to question myself before.
I just wish we get to travel once together and you get to see the person I am and not what you assume me to be. I put you through a lot too unwarrantedly. 
I don‚Äôt want to be in that person ever to cause pain to you. I always want to see you do the best. 
I will try to never bother you. Also I know you might never even a feel a tinge of feeling for me. 
I am sorry for everything till now and ever.
Sorry. üôè
